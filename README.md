# 🎴 C++ UNO
> A fully playable 2-4 player UNO game in C++ featuring polymorphism, a circular doubly linked list, and a colorful ANSI terminal UI experience!

---

# ⋆｡°✩ ★ FEATURES
- **2-4 player support** - 1 human player vs up to 3 AI opponents
- **Full UNO ruleset** - number cards, action cards (Skip, Reverse, +2), and wild cards (+4, Wild)
- **Rainbow ANSI terminal UI** - every program needs a little color. Every card prints in its own color, special cards in bold, current player highlighted in lavender
- **Circular doubly linked list** for player turn management. Supports Reverse, Skip, and wrap-around naturally
- **AI thinking delay** - 3-7 second randomized pause per AI turn (so the immersion feels real)
- **UNO detection** - calls out players who have 1 card left, and human prompted to either call it or skip it (punished greatly for the latter)
- **Duplicate card grouping** - displays ```Red 8 (x2)``` instead of listing the same card twice
- **Played card stacking** - cards already played appear greyed out in your hand
- **Reshuffle logic** - automatically reshuffles the discard pile into the draw pile if it runs out mid-game

# ⋆｡°✩ ★ TECH STACK AND SKILLS DEMONSTRATED

| Concept | Implementation |
|---|---|
|**Abstract classes + polymorphism**|`Card` is an abstract base class; `NumberCard`, `ActionCard`, and `WildCard` each override `CanPlayOn()`|
|**Circular doubly linked list**|`Lineup` manages player turn order with wrap-around, direction reversal, and skip logic|
|**Dynamic memory management**|`Game` owns all `Card*` and `Player*` objects; safe destructor chain with no memory leaks|
|**File I/O parsing**|`uno_deck.txt` parsed with `getline()` and delimiter splitting to construct the right subclass per card|
|**Operator overloading**|`Card::operator==` compares cards by color and value for duplicate detection|
|`enum class`|`CardColor` scoped enum for type-safe color selection in wild card logic|
|**ANSI terminal UI**|RGB codes via `Colors.h` - fully themeable card display system|
|**Separation of concerns**|`Card` describes itself, `Player` manages a hand, `Lineup` manages order, `Game` runs everything|

# ⋆｡°✩ ★ CARD HIERARCHY

```
Card  (abstract base — CanPlayOn() is pure virtual)
├── NumberCard    (colors: red/yellow/green/blue, values: 0-9)
├── ActionCard    (Skip, Reverse, +2 — colored)
└── WildCard      (+4, Wild — color chosen at play time)
```

# ⋆｡°✩ ★ HOW TO BUILD AND RUN

## Requirements
- Windows (uses `windows.h` for ANSI color support)
- Visual Studio 2022 or later
- C++ 20 or later


## Steps 
### 1. **Clone the repo**
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/bbraide/UnoGame.git
cd UnoGame
```

### 2. **Open in Visual Studio**
- Open `uno-cpp/UnoGame/UnoGame.sln` in Visual Studio 2022 (or later)

### 3. **Check the deck file location**
- Visual Studio looks for files relative to the project folder. Ensure `uno_deck.txt` is inside:
  `uno-cpp/UnoGame/UnoGame/uno_deck.txt`
- *Note: If it's missing, copy the one from the root folder into that directory!*

### 4. **Set C++ Standard to C++20**
- Right-click project → **Properties** → **Configuration Properties** → **General** → **C++ Language Standard** → `ISO C++20 Standard (/std:c++20)`

### 5. **Build & Run**
- Hit `Ctrl+F5` and end some friendships!

> [!NOTE] 
> ANSI colors require Windows 10 or later. The game automatically enables virtual terminal processing on startup.

# ⋆｡°✩ ★ HOW TO PLAY

The game is fully interactive and will prompt you whenever input is needed.
- **Place Cards** (option ***3***): Enter the __<ins>card type</ins>__, __<ins>color</ins>__, and __<ins>number</ins>__ (in three separate steps) corresponding to the card you want to play.
- **Draw from pile** (option ***4***): If you have no playable cards, you can choose to draw a card.
- **Wilds**: Follow the on-screen prompt to choose a new color.

> [!WARNING]
> **Input Stability**: Currently, the game expects the correct data types (integers for selection, etc.). Entering letters when a number is expected may cause the game to crash. Input validation is a work-in-progress for v1.1!

  <br>
  
- Match the top card by **color** OR **number/action**
- **Skip** — next player loses their turn
- **Reverse** — play direction flips (acts as Skip in 2-player)
- **+2** — next player draws 2 cards and loses their turn
- **Wild** — play anytime, choose any color
- **+4** — play anytime, next player draws 4 cards and loses their turn, then choose any color
- When you draw from the pile, you may immediately play it if it's valid
- If the draw pile runs out, the discard pile is automatically reshuffled
- First player to **0 cards** wins!

# ⋆｡°✩ ★ YOUR TURN MENU

```
What's your move?
1. View my cards
2. See player order
3. Place cards
4. Draw from pile
5. Rules
6. Quit
```

>[!WARNING]
>Choosing "Nah" when you have one card left will cost you two cards, so choose carefully 👀

# ⋆｡°✩ ★ ROADMAP

- **v1.1** — inclusive pronoun system for all players (comma-delimited input: `she,her,her` / `they,them,their` / custom neopronouns fully supported), smarter AI (prefers special cards), +2/+4 stacking rules, playable card highlighting
- **v1.2** — tournament mode (first to win 3 rounds), score tracking across games
- **v2.0** — cross-platform port (Linux/Mac), GUI with raylib or SDL
